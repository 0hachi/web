## Raison d'être

*This website* is a way to *express myself artistically* and *technically*; much like a *blank canvas.*  
<br />

Despite not being a designer, I have a keen interest in *visual arts;* pursuing *beauty* and *functionality* is my goal.

## Intrinsics

Before sperging out about the technicalities, I'd like to mention my *biggest inspirations* for this website;

- [Igor Bedesqui](https://igorbedesqui.com) for ["Schrodinger's Minimalism"](https://igorbedesqui.com/writing/schrodinger-minimalism)
- [Feáim Pacífica](https://fea.monster) for her constant feedback, inspiration, and support
- [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com/) for their visual arts and approach to documentation

### Typefaces

- [Aileron](https://dotcolon.net/font/aileron/) by Sora Sagano for paragraphs
- [Medio](https://dotcolon.net/font/medio/) by Sora Sagano for headings

### Colours

- [ ]{.circle .white} White Background
- [ ]{.circle .primrose} Primrose Accent
- [ ]{.circle .silver} Silver Paragraph
- [ ]{.circle .black} Black Highlight
- [ ]{.circle .dune} Dune Heading

### Tooling

The website is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and plain *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript*; leveraging [Three.js](https://threejs.org) for 3D graphics.  
<br />

Blog posts are *hackily* converted from markdown to HTML using a *custom Vite plugin*, which also *injects hashed assets* into the HTML files by parsing the *Vite manifest*.


## Ad futurum

> *A Latin phrase* meaning "for the future."  

<br />

I plan to build a *knowledge base* by documenting my *projects*, *thoughts*, and *experiences*; as well as a *portfolio* showcasing my *artistic* and *technical* endeavours.  
<br />

Over the years, I'd like for this website to become a *time capsule* of my *growth* and *development*; a *reflection* of my *past*, *present*, and *future* self.
